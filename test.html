<h1>Assignment 03 Basic html File</h1>



Some of my hobbies include lifting, playing baseball, fishing, spending time with my family and traveling. This past summer we traveled to Spain for a vacation and spent time with my family from England. We started out in Barcelona for three days and then went to the Spanish island of Mallorca. We stayed in a large villa with 30 of my family members. All of them were from England, so of course they sure do love their alcohol LOL.



<b>We went to a lot of beaches and explored the smaller towns that are on the island. It was certainly a different culture than what I am used to in the US.</b>



<h2>Why I chose Juniata</h2>



<i>Here I want to talk about why I decided to enroll and come to Juniata.</i>



<u>I was originally recruited here to play baseball, but I never was sure if I wanted to play in college or not.</u>



I figured "why not" when I was asked to come for a visit and kept telling myself to keep an open mind since I had never heard of this school before coming here. As soon as I got on campus, I immediately liked the small-town feel and smaller size. Everyone knew of everyone and I greatly enjoyed my tour. Once I found out how good of a science school Juniata is, I figured the best decision would be to commit here and come here and I have not had a single regret.
